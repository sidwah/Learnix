# Learnix Badge System - Revised Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a revised implementation plan for the Learnix Badge System, focusing on a clearer separation between regular achievement badges and special achievement badges. The system will enhance student engagement through meaningful digital recognition that acknowledges specific learning accomplishments. This plan outlines the refined badge architecture, streamlined criteria, implementation approach, and technical details.

The system now encompasses two distinct components:
1. **Regular Achievement Badges** that reward students for specific course-related accomplishments
2. **Special Achievement Badges** that recognize extraordinary, platform-wide accomplishments

## 1. Badge System Rationale & Logic

### 1.1 Core Design Philosophy
The revised badge system operates on the principle that badges should be:
- **Meaningful**: Each badge represents a clear, significant achievement
- **Distinct**: Regular badges and special badges serve different purposes
- **Attainable**: Regular badges are achievable through normal course progression
- **Aspirational**: Special badges require dedication and significant investment
- **Measurable**: All criteria are objectively trackable in the database

### 1.2 Regular vs. Special Achievement Badges
- **Regular Achievement Badges** focus on specific, course-level accomplishments like completing a course, acing a quiz, or maintaining weekly consistency. These badges create immediate positive feedback loops within the learning process.
- **Special Achievement Badges** recognize extraordinary, platform-wide dedication like completing numerous courses or earning multiple other badges. These special badges serve as "meta-achievements" that encourage long-term platform engagement.

## 2. Badge Types & Achievement Criteria

### 2.1 Regular Achievement Badges

#### 2.1.1 Course Completion Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/course_completion.svg`
- **Description**: Awarded for successfully completing all course content
- **Criteria**: All topics in a course are marked as completed
- **Data Validation**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_topics, 
         SUM(CASE WHEN p.completion_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_topics
  FROM enrollments e
  JOIN section_topics st ON st.section_id IN (SELECT section_id FROM course_sections WHERE course_id = e.course_id)
  LEFT JOIN progress p ON p.topic_id = st.topic_id AND p.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
  WHERE e.user_id = ? AND e.course_id = ?
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When `total_topics = completed_topics` for a course

#### 2.1.2 Section Completion Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/section_completion.svg`
- **Description**: Awarded for completing all content in a course section
- **Criteria**: All topics in a section are marked as completed
- **Data Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_topics, 
         SUM(CASE WHEN p.completion_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_topics
  FROM section_topics st
  LEFT JOIN progress p ON p.topic_id = st.topic_id AND p.enrollment_id = ?
  WHERE st.section_id = ?
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When `total_topics = completed_topics` for a section

#### 2.1.3 Perfect Score Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/perfect_score.svg`
- **Description**: Awarded for achieving a perfect score on a quiz on the first attempt
- **Criteria**: 100% score on a quiz, earned on the first attempt only
- **Data Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT attempt_number, score
  FROM student_quiz_attempts
  WHERE user_id = ? AND quiz_id = ?
  ORDER BY attempt_number ASC
  LIMIT 1
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When first attempt has `score = 100`

#### 2.1.4 Speed Learner Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/speed_learner.svg`
- **Description**: Awarded for completing a course quickly
- **Criteria**: 
  - Beginner courses: Completion within 3 days of enrollment
  - Intermediate courses: Completion within 7 days of enrollment
  - Advanced courses: Completion within 14 days of enrollment
- **Data Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT c.course_level, e.enrolled_at, 
         MAX(p.completion_date) as last_completion_date
  FROM enrollments e
  JOIN courses c ON c.course_id = e.course_id
  JOIN progress p ON p.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
  WHERE e.user_id = ? AND e.course_id = ?
  GROUP BY e.enrollment_id
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When time between `enrolled_at` and `last_completion_date` is less than the threshold for the course level

#### 2.1.5 Achievement Hunter Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/top_performer.svg` (filename preserved)
- **Description**: Awarded for earning multiple badges within a single course
- **Criteria**: Earns 3+ other badges in a single course
- **Data Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) as badge_count
  FROM user_badges
  WHERE user_id = ? AND course_id = ? AND badge_id != ?  -- Exclude this badge type
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When `badge_count >= 3` for a course

#### 2.1.6 Consistency Badge
- **File**: `assets/img/badges/icons/streak.svg` (filename preserved)
- **Description**: Awarded for consistent weekly engagement
- **Criteria**: Completes at least one topic per week for 4 consecutive weeks
- **Data Validation**:
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    WEEK(completion_date) as week_number,
    COUNT(DISTINCT topic_id) as topics_completed
  FROM progress
  WHERE user_id = ? 
    AND completion_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 28 DAY)
  GROUP BY WEEK(completion_date)

  SELECT COUNT(*) as completed_courses
  FROM enrollments
  WHERE user_id = ? AND status = 'Completed'
  ```
- **Award Trigger**: When `current_streak_days >= 30` AND `completed_courses >= 10`

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Database Schema Updates

Add the following database tables to support the badge system:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `badges` (
  `badge_id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `description` text,
  `badge_type` enum('course_completion','section_completion','perfect_score','speed_learner','achievement_hunter','consistency','special_basic','special_gold','special_platinum') NOT NULL,

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 BadgeHandler Class
```php
class BadgeHandler {
    private $db;
    
    public function __construct($db) {
        $this->db = $db;
    }
    
    public function checkAndAwardBadges($userId, $courseId = null, $sectionId = null) {
        // Check all applicable badge types
        $this->checkCourseCompletionBadge($userId, $courseId);
        $this->checkSectionCompletionBadge($userId, $sectionId);
        $this->checkPerfectScoreBadge($userId, $quizId);
        $this->checkSpeedLearnerBadge($userId, $courseId);
        $this->checkAchievementHunterBadge($userId, $courseId);
        $this->checkConsistencyBadge($userId);
        
        // Check special achievements
        $this->checkSpecialAchievements($userId);
    }
    
    public function awardBadge($userId, $badgeId, $courseId = null, $sectionId = null, $additionalData = null) {
        // Check if user already has this badge
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT user_badge_id FROM user_badges 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND badge_id = ? 
            AND (course_id = ? OR course_id IS NULL) 
            AND (section_id = ? OR section_id IS NULL)");
        $stmt->bind_param("iiii", $userId, $badgeId, $courseId, $sectionId);
        $stmt->execute();
        $result = $stmt->get_result();
        
        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
            // User already has this badge
            return false;
        }
        
        // Insert the new badge
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("INSERT INTO user_badges 
            (user_id, badge_id, course_id, section_id, additional_data) 
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
        $jsonData = $additionalData ? json_encode($additionalData) : null;
        $stmt->bind_param("iiiss", $userId, $badgeId, $courseId, $sectionId, $jsonData);
        
        if ($stmt->execute()) {
            $this->createBadgeNotification($userId, $badgeId);
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private function createBadgeNotification($userId, $badgeId) {
        // Get badge details
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT name, description FROM badges WHERE badge_id = ?");
        $stmt->bind_param("i", $badgeId);
        $stmt->execute();
        $result = $stmt->get_result();
        $badge = $result->fetch_assoc();
        
        // Create notification
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("INSERT INTO user_notifications 
            (user_id, type, title, message, related_id, related_type) 
            VALUES (?, 'badge', ?, ?, ?, 'badge')");
        
        $title = "New Badge Earned: {$badge['name']}";
        $message = "Congratulations! You've earned the {$badge['name']} badge. {$badge['description']}";
        
        $stmt->bind_param("issi", $userId, $title, $message, $badgeId);
        $stmt->execute();
    }
    
    // Individual badge check methods would be implemented here
    // ...
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Badge Qualification Methods 
These methods would be implemented within the BadgeHandler class:

```php
private function checkCourseCompletionBadge($userId, $courseId) {
    if (!$courseId) return false;
    
    $query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_topics, 
             SUM(CASE WHEN p.completion_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_topics
      FROM enrollments e
      JOIN section_topics st ON st.section_id IN (SELECT section_id FROM course_sections WHERE course_id = e.course_id)
      LEFT JOIN progress p ON p.topic_id = st.topic_id AND p.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
      WHERE e.user_id = ? AND e.course_id = ?";
    
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("ii", $userId, $courseId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $data = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($data['total_topics'] > 0 && $data['total_topics'] == $data['completed_topics']) {
        // Fetch the course completion badge ID
        $badgeQuery = "SELECT badge_id FROM badges WHERE badge_type = 'course_completion' AND is_active = 1";
        $badge = $this->db->query($badgeQuery)->fetch_assoc();
        
        if ($badge) {
            return $this->awardBadge($userId, $badge['badge_id'], $courseId);
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

private function checkSpecialAchievements($userId) {
    // Check Basic Special Achievement (10+ courses completed)
    $query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as completed_courses
              FROM enrollments
              WHERE user_id = ? AND status = 'Completed'";
    
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $userId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $data = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($data['completed_courses'] >= 10) {
        // Fetch the basic special achievement badge ID
        $badgeQuery = "SELECT badge_id FROM badges WHERE badge_type = 'special_basic' AND is_active = 1";
        $badge = $this->db->query($badgeQuery)->fetch_assoc();
        
        if ($badge) {
            $this->awardBadge($userId, $badge['badge_id'], null, null, ['courses_completed' => $data['completed_courses']]);
        }
    }
    
    // Check Gold Special Achievement (20+ regular badges)
    $query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as badge_count
              FROM user_badges ub
              JOIN badges b ON ub.badge_id = b.badge_id
              WHERE ub.user_id = ? 
                AND b.badge_type NOT LIKE 'special_%'";
    
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $userId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $data = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($data['badge_count'] >= 20) {
        // Fetch the gold special achievement badge ID
        $badgeQuery = "SELECT badge_id FROM badges WHERE badge_type = 'special_gold' AND is_active = 1";
        $badge = $this->db->query($badgeQuery)->fetch_assoc();
        
        if ($badge) {
            $this->awardBadge($userId, $badge['badge_id'], null, null, ['badges_earned' => $data['badge_count']]);
        }
    }
    
    // Check Platinum Special Achievement (30+ day streak AND 10+ courses)
    // First check streak
    $query = "SELECT current_streak_days
              FROM user_learning_stats
              WHERE user_id = ?";
    
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $userId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $streakData = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($streakData && $streakData['current_streak_days'] >= 30 && $data['completed_courses'] >= 10) {
        // Fetch the platinum special achievement badge ID
        $badgeQuery = "SELECT badge_id FROM badges WHERE badge_type = 'special_platinum' AND is_active = 1";
        $badge = $this->db->query($badgeQuery)->fetch_assoc();
        
        if ($badge) {
            $this->awardBadge($userId, $badge['badge_id'], null, null, [
                'streak_days' => $streakData['current_streak_days'],
                'courses_completed' => $data['completed_courses']
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Integration with Progress Tracking

The badge system would be integrated with the progress tracking system through the following hooks:

#### 3.3.1 Topic Completion Hook
```php
function onTopicCompletion($userId, $enrollmentId, $topicId) {
    global $db;
    
    // Get course and section information
    $query = "SELECT e.course_id, st.section_id 
              FROM enrollments e
              JOIN section_topics st ON st.topic_id = ?
              WHERE e.enrollment_id = ?";
    
    $stmt = $db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("ii", $topicId, $enrollmentId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $data = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($data) {
        $badgeHandler = new BadgeHandler($db);
        $badgeHandler->checkAndAwardBadges($userId, $data['course_id'], $data['section_id']);
        
        // Update learning stats
        updateLearningStats($userId);
    }
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Quiz Completion Hook
```php
function onQuizCompletion($userId, $quizId, $score, $attemptNumber) {
    global $db;
    
    // Get course and section information
    $query = "SELECT sq.section_id, cs.course_id
              FROM section_quizzes sq
              JOIN course_sections cs ON cs.section_id = sq.section_id
              WHERE sq.quiz_id = ?";
    
    $stmt = $db->prepare($query);
    $stmt->bind_param("i", $quizId);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->get_result();
    $data = $result->fetch_assoc();
    
    if ($data) {
        $badgeHandler = new BadgeHandler($db);
        
        // Check perfect score badge specifically
        if ($score == 100 && $attemptNumber == 1) {
            // Get the perfect score badge ID
            $badgeQuery = "SELECT badge_id FROM badges WHERE badge_type = 'perfect_score' AND is_active = 1";
            $badge = $db->query($badgeQuery)->fetch_assoc();
            
            if ($badge) {
                $badgeHandler->awardBadge($userId, $badge['badge_id'], $data['course_id'], $data['section_id'], [
                    'quiz_id' => $quizId,
                    'score' => $score,
                    'attempt' => $attemptNumber
                ]);
            }
        }
        
        // Check other badges
        $badgeHandler->checkAndAwardBadges($userId, $data['course_id'], $data['section_id']);
        
        // Update learning stats
        updateLearningStats($userId);
    }
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Learning Stats Update
```php
function updateLearningStats($userId) {
    global $db;
    
    // Check if user has stats record
    $query = "SELECT user_id, last_activity_date, current_streak_days

                          total_learning_days = total_learning_days + 1
                      WHERE user_id = ?";
            
            $stmt = $db->prepare($query);
            $stmt->bind_param("siii", $today, $newStreak, $newStreak, $userId);
            $stmt->execute();
        } else {
            // Streak broken
            $query = "UPDATE user_learning_stats

                          current_streak_days = 1,
                          total_learning_days = total_learning_days + 1
                      WHERE user_id = ?";
            
            $stmt = $db->prepare($query);
            $stmt->bind_param("si", $today, $userId);
            $stmt->execute();

        $query = "INSERT INTO user_learning_stats
                  (user_id, last_activity_date, current_streak_days, longest_streak_days, total_learning_days)
                  VALUES (?, ?, 1, 1, 1)";
        
        $stmt = $db->prepare($query);

The badge display interface will be implemented in `student/my-badges.php` with the following features:

- Grid layout of earned badges with visual distinction between regular and special badges
- Badge details on click/hover showing criteria and date earned
- Motivational messaging for unearned badges
- Progress indicators for badges in progress
- Badge filtering and sorting options

### 4.2 Badge Notification System

Badge notifications will be displayed using toast notifications with:

- Attractive badge icon
- Congratulatory message
- Brief description of achievement
- Animation for visual appeal

### 4.3 Profile Integration

Badges will be integrated into user profiles with:

- Featured badges section on profile
- Option to set favorite badges
- Badge count and recent achievements
- Special achievement badges highlighted

## 6. Technical Guidelines

### 6.1 Badge SVG Design Guidelines
- Regular badges: 200x200px SVG format
- Special badges: 250x250px SVG format
- Use consistent color scheme for badge types
- Special badges should be visually distinct and prestigious
- Include transparent areas for visual layering
- Use vector graphics for crisp display at all sizes

### 6.2 Database Performance Considerations
- Index all badge-related queries
- Cache badge award status when appropriate
- Batch badge checks for performance
- Use transactions for data integrity

### 6.3 Security Considerations
- Validate all badge award criteria server-side
- Prevent badge manipulation through client-side code
- Log all badge awards for audit
- Implement rate limiting for badge checks

## 7. Logic Behind the Revised System

The revised badge system addresses several key improvements over the original plan:

### 7.1 Clearer Badge Hierarchy
By separating regular achievement badges from special achievement badges, the system creates a clearer progression path. Regular badges provide immediate feedback for course-specific accomplishments, while special badges represent extraordinary, long-term commitment to learning.

### 7.2 More Measurable Criteria
The revised criteria rely on fixed thresholds rather than relative comparisons (like "faster than average" or "top performers"). This makes badge qualification more transparent and predictable for users, while also simplifying implementation.

### 7.3 Better Database Integration
The revised system is carefully designed to work with the existing database schema, with clear SQL queries defined for each badge qualification check. New tables are minimal and focused on supporting the badge functionality without redundancy.

### 7.4 Reduced Overlap
The original plan had significant overlap between badge types (e.g., streak badge vs. platinum tier). The revised system ensures each badge represents a distinct accomplishment with minimal redundancy.

### 7.5 Enhanced Motivational Structure
The revised system creates both short-term motivational goals (regular badges) and long-term aspirational achievements (special badges). This dual approach encourages both immediate engagement and long-term platform loyalty.

### 7.6 Simplified Visual Implementation
Rather than combining badge tiers with achievement types, the revised system treats each badge as a distinct visual element. This simplifies the implementation while still maintaining a clear visual hierarchy between regular and special badges.

## 8. Conclusion

The revised Learnix Badge System provides a more structured, meaningful approach to student achievement recognition. By clearly separating regular badges from special achievements, the system creates both immediate engagement rewards and long-term aspirational goals.

The implementation plan prioritizes measurable criteria that can be reliably tracked in the database, ensuring badges are awarded consistently and transparently. The phased implementation approach allows for iterative development and testing, with a focus on user experience and technical robustness.

With this revised system, Learnix will motivate students through meaningful recognition while driving key engagement metrics such as course completion rates, learning consistency, and platform retention.
