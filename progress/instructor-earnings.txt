### Key Business Logic:

- [✓] **Payment Processing Timeline**:
   - Earnings stay in "Pending" status for 15 days
   - After 15 days, they become "Available" for withdrawal
   - Instructors can see the expected availability date

- [✓] **Revenue Calculation**:
   - Instructor share is stored directly in the database
   - Platform fees are tracked separately
   - Various aggregation functions calculate totals by time period, course, and category

- [✓] **Transaction Filtering and Display**:
   - AJAX-based filtering for real-time updates without page refreshes
   - Client-side search capabilities for further refinement
   - Efficient pagination system for handling large transaction volumes
   - Status tooltips to help instructors understand transaction lifecycle

- [ ] **Payment Method Management**:
   - Add and verify payment methods
   - Switch between default payment methods
   - Support for multiple payment providers

- [ ] **Withdrawal Processing**:
   - Request withdrawals of available funds
   - Track withdrawal status through the pipeline
   - View withdrawal history and transaction details

## What's Planned Next

1. **Payout Settings Page Implementation**
   - [ ] Add/edit payment methods
   - [ ] Set withdrawal preferences
   - [ ] View payout history
   - [ ] Process withdrawal requests
   - [ ] Payment method verification workflow

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test with real data and transaction flow
   - [ ] Verify calculations and display accuracy
   - [ ] Test export functionality with large datasets
   - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

3. **User Feedback Collection**
   - [ ] Gather instructor feedback on usability
   - [ ] Identify additional features or improvements needed
   - [ ] Implement suggested adjustments

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create user documentation for instructors
   - [ ] Document code for future maintenance
   - [ ] Create API documentation for potential integrations

## Technical Notes

- The system uses PHP for server-side logic
- MySQL database for data storage
- AJAX for asynchronous data loading and filtering
- ApexCharts for data visualization
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- DataTables for advanced table functionality
- Uses local currency format (GHS ₵)
- All monetary values are stored and handled as decimal types
- Security measures include prepared statements for all database queries
- Filter and sanitization of output for display
- Client-side caching for improved performance

The earnings system now includes both the main earnings dashboard and a comprehensive transaction history page. The interface is highly interactive, with real-time filtering, tooltips for clarity, and robust export functionality. The next phase will focus on implementing the payout settings page, conducting thorough testing, and incorporating user feedback to refine the system further.


# Learnix LMS Quiz System Implementation Documentation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of the quiz system for the Learnix Learning Management System as outlined in the implementation plan. The quiz system allows students to take quizzes as part of their course content, with features such as timed quizzes, multiple attempts, various question types, and detailed results.

## Database Structure

The quiz system utilizes the following database tables, which were already established in the schema:

1. **section_quizzes**: Stores quiz metadata, including title, description, time limits, pass marks, etc.
2. **quiz_questions**: Contains question content, type, points, and difficulty levels
3. **quiz_answers**: Stores answer options for questions and indicates correct answers
4. **student_quiz_attempts**: Tracks student attempts, including start/end times and scores
5. **student_question_responses**: Records student answers for each question
6. **student_answer_selections**: Manages multiple-choice selection data
7. **quiz_sessions**: Manages active quiz sessions to handle browser refreshes and maintain state
8. **student_matching_responses**: Stores matching question responses
